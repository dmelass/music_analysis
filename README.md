Passion Project: Music Analysis
==============

This is my final project at my data science bootcamp at Metis. In this project I will analyze musical elements of songs from 11 countries (Lebanon, Egypt, United States, France, Italy, Nigeria, Mexico, China, Japan, India, Cuba) using metadata gathered from echonest's API.

<b>In this respository...</b>

data_gathering.py - this script collects 500+ artist names from the chosen countries, and then gathers 5 songs per artist and puts all the song metadata in a pandas dataframe.

I will update the README as I complete this project.
